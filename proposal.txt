Secure Website Hosting Proposal

To host a secure website, we need a well-rounded plan to protect data, keep the site reliable, 
and guard against cyber threats. Here’s how we can set up, manage, and address challenges to ensure the site’s safety.

Getting Started:
The first step is choosing a hosting provider that prioritizes security. Look for one that includes free SSL certification 
for encrypted data, secure file transfers (SFTP), and a web application firewall (WAF) to block malicious traffic. 
It’s also important to have DDoS protection to handle traffic spikes and automated backups to safeguard our data.

Once hosting is in place, we’ll enable SSL to encrypt communication between the site and its users. 
Strong passwords and two-factor authentication (2FA) will protect admin accounts, while changing default login 
URLs will make it harder for hackers to break in. Tools like Wordfence can scan for vulnerabilities and stop malware 
before it causes harm. Setting up automated backups will ensure we always have a fallback in case something goes wrong.

Ongoing Security:
Keeping the site safe doesn’t stop at setup. Regular updates for the content management system (CMS), plugins, and 
themes are essential. Unused plugins and themes should be removed—they’re just extra doors hackers can try to open. 
Tools like Limit Login Attempts Reloaded can monitor login activity and block suspicious IP addresses. Routine checks of 
server logs and vulnerability scans will help us catch potential issues early.

Challenges to Watch Out For:
Updating software can sometimes cause compatibility issues, breaking parts of the site. That’s why it’s important to 
test updates in a staging environment before applying them to the live site. Advanced security features, like managed hosting, 
can add to costs, but they’re worth it for sensitive or high-traffic sites. Lastly, human error—like weak passwords or skipped 
updates—is always a risk. Regular training for the team can help prevent mistakes.

By following these steps, we can create a secure, reliable website that protects user data and provides a great 
experience for everyone.
