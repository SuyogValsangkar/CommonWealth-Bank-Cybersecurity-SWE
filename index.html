           <h2> Why Is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>

            <p> Protecting your personal information and maintaining good cybersecurity practices 
                is important in preventing customer account takeovers. This happens when a criminal
                steals account information with the intention to gain unauthorized access to personal
                accounts and information. Often times, criminals will use the information to create
                a new fake account benefiting the fraudster.
            </p> 

            <h2> How Do Criminals Steal Your Info? </h2>

            <p> Criminals rely on many different techniques to try and steal data. The most common 
                method relies on deception and an effort to have you yourself reveal personal information
                directly to the criminal. Below are some common techniques that criminals use to try and
                steal your personal information.
            </p>

            <ul style = "list-style-type:square"> 
                <li> <strong> Phishing Emails: </strong> An email which appears to come form a legitimate source 
                    but damands personal information, which otherwise would not be shared over email. </li>
                <li> <strong> Impersonations: </strong> Criminals will pretend to work for or represent a legitimate 
                    institution and ask for personal information online or over the phone. </li>
                <li> <strong> Stolen Credentials: </strong> If personal information is leaked or stolen, criminals
                    can buy this information on the "dark web". </li>
                <li> <strong> Spyware: </strong> Some criminals will attempt to install malicious software through texts, 
                    emails, and free links. These softwares will then record keystrokes to steal personal information. </li>
                <li> <strong> Dumpster Diving: </strong> An old-fashioned method in which criminals will attempt to recover 
                    personal information from incorrectly shredded documents.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Signs That Your Information Has Been Compromised: </h2>

            <ul style = "list-style-type:square;">
                <li> Unfamiliar or unathorized transactions. Money movement, deposits and withdrawls. </li>
                <li> Missing funds or securities. </li>
                <li> Incorrect or unauthorized updates to an account. Such as changes in address, 
                     phone number, or email. </li>
                <li> Missing documentation. Such as account statements, reciepts, confirmations, 
                     and other finanalcial documents. </li>

            </ul>

            <h2> How You Can Protect Your Information: </h2>

            <p> Because financial institutions are obligated to protect your information, and provide 
                robust defense measures against cyber threats, criminals often find success by targetting 
                individual people rather than large institutions. Maintaining good cybersecurity practices 
                (like the tips listed below) are an effective way to keep yourself, your information, and your 
                accounts safe from crminals.
            </p>

            <ul style = "list-style-type:square">
                <li> <strong> Use security software that automatically updates: </strong> Criminals are always 
                    searching for new ways to steal personal information, often times taking advantage of outdated 
                    software and protection. Using a security software which automatically updates will ensure 
                    your information is kept safe using the latest and best techniques. </li>
                <li> <strong> Treat personal information like cash: </strong> Before giving out your personal 
                    information, so your research on who will be receiving it, and what they intend to do 
                    with it. Do not assume that all individuals and institutions are trustworthy. </li>
                <li> <strong> Make sure your connection in encrypted: </strong> When giving out personal information 
                    online through a website, check to see whether the web address begins with “https” or look 
                    for a lock icon next to the web address. This indicates your connection is encrypted and lowers 
                    the chance of a criminal stealing your information. </li>
                <li> <strong> Protect your passwords: </strong> When creating an account or a login for your personal 
                    information make sure you create a strong password. Some tips to create a robust password are 
                    to make it long, mix in letters, numbers, and special characters, never share passwords between 
                    different accounts, and do not include your personal details in your passwords. </li>
            </ul>
